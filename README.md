# CY300
Machine Learning Project

The goal of this project is to design a machine learning algorithm that can
colorize black and white images.

We will use the Keras front end with a TensorFlow backend to teach our algorithm and tkinter to create our GUI.

Requirements: 
Python 3.7 or Later/
Numpy/
Keras Frontend with TensorFlow Backend/
Pillow/
Tkinter/
Skimage/


Running the Algorithm:
This project was run within a Jupyter Notebooks file with a supported GPU for image processing/
Run each block of code as it is included within the Notebook file to construct your model/
The user will need to input the images they want colorized into the Test Folder along with the current images/
They will be outputted into the Results folder/
With supported CPUs, run as regular python file/
For unsupported CPUs:/
Floydhub/
Device with Supported CPU/
Other cloud computing software

Constraints:/
This project is still very much in development/
