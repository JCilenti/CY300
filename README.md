# CY300
Machine Learning Project

The goal of this project is to design a machine learning algorithm that can
colorize black and white images.

We will use the Keras front end with a TensorFlow backend to teach our algorithm and tkinter to create our GUI.

Requirements: 
Python 3.7 or Later/
Numpy/
Keras Frontend with TensorFlow Backend/
Pillow/
Tkinter/

Running the Algorithm:
With supported CPUs, run as regular python file
For unsupported CPUs:
Floydhub/
Device with Supported CPU/
Other cloud computing software
